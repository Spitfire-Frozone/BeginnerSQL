# BeginnerSQL
I am teaching myself SQL. Here is repo with some notes covering the basics. This is mostly for me. 

For a real beginners guide use: [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp) and [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/sql-operators-tutorial/). This is what I mostly used, and some parts will be lifted from this, but I writing things out for myself helps me remember things better.
